title: Upgrading from the free to the pro edition
---

### No Action required when upgrading

Upgrading from the free edition is very easy. Pro works with 
the data structures from the free edition and adds additional data when needed.

Simply install to pro edition and make sure to uninstall the free edition, as 
there will be two menu entries otherwise.

### Downgrading

Downgrading from the Pro edition is possible but highly discouraged
as the additional data added by the pro edition will be lost
when editing the story map with the free app, this includes but is
not limited to settings, timeframe information and virtual issue links.

The free edition will also not work for story maps where a custom
epic type is configured.
