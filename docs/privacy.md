### Definition of Data

Story Mapping App collects and processes three types of data:

- User generated content (Jira content like issues, releases, sprints, settings, etc)
- Error reports
- Install information (Cloud only)

Realigned Technologies does NOT use any type of product analytics software (e.g. Google Analytics)
and does NOT collect any personal user information.

### Data residency information

#### User Generated Content

All user generated content (see above) is stored within your
Jira instance, both on Cloud, Server and Data Center.
None of this data is stored by us.

The Cloud version of Story Mapping App is hosted in Helsinki, Finland
and all data is processed within the European Union. 

#### Install information (Cloud only)

To enable installation and licensing via the Atlassian Marketplace
we collect information about the instance and license upon
installation of the app in your Cloud instance.

This information is stored in our databases currently located
in Helsinki, Finland.

#### Error Reports

We use Sentry.io for error reporting on all products.
