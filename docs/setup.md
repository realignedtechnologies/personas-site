After installation, Personas for Jira app will be available in 
all Jira projects (all Project types are supported).

When you open the app, you will be prompted to create your first
persona profile. Specify a persona name and a brief description (optional)
and select either a photo from the Unsplash library or a solid color
to represent the Persona. This photo or color will also be visible
in issues linked to this Persona.

Once you have created the Persona, you can edit the basic fields
provided by the app which are currently "Motivation", "Goals" and "Blockers".

You can add any field you need via the Overview page - Click "Fields" 
in the top right hand corner and add either a global field or a field scoped
to the current project.

After doing so, you can click on the persona in order to edit the 
newly available fields and complete the Persona profile.
